# Base64 Encoding & Decoding Library
I decided to write this Base64 encoding & decoding library to see how far I could take optimization of the internal algoritms and routines. It is also fairly compact but the priority lies with it's performance. If not the fastest, it is atleast in the top in terms of absolute performance. The library is single-threaded and written in C, it ofcourse has no dependencies.

# Usage
The library can be used, in a variety of cases, think about websocket handshakes, encoding and decoding links or images, strings of data and so on.
